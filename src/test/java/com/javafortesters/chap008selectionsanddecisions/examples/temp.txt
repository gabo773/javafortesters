Create a method which uses a switch statement to return a String depending on the shortCode passed in
as a parameter to the method:
given “UK” return “United Kingdom”
given “US” return “United States”
given “USA” return “United States”
given “FR” return “France”
given “SE” return “Sweden”
given any other value, return “Rest Of World”
For bonus points, make the short code case insensitive i.e. “uK”, “UK”, “Uk”, “uk” should all return
“United Kingdom”e
