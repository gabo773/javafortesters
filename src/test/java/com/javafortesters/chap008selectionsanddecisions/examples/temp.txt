Create a method which uses a switch statement to
return a String representing the int passed in as
a parameter to the method:
given 1 return "One"
given 2 return "Two"
given 3 return "Three"
given 4 return "Four"
given an integer > 4, return "Too big"
given an integer < 1, return "Too small"
As an experiment, also write the method such that
every case in the switch is implemented as a return
so no variables or break statements are used.
